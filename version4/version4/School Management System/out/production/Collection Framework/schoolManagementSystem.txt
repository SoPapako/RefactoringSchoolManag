Java Project Idea: School management system is another beginner level project idea that will help you implement your
skills in Java. This project is developed for schools to store and manage all data and records related to school.
 All information related to students, teachers, and staff of the school is stored in the database. System also provides
 the facility to calculate and manage attendance of students.

There are four types of users in this system: admin, student and teacher. Admin handles the whole system
and has rights to access the data of other users. He can delete and modify the records of students, teachers or
 any staff member. Teachers can keep track of attendance and enter the marks and grades obtained by the student in exams.
  Students can view their details including attendance and performance. Each user of the system has to login with a
  valid username and password
